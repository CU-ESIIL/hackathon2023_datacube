## Surviving in an ever-changing environment
> ### "**Environment**, the complex of physical, chemical, and biotic factors that act upon an organism or an ecological community and ultimately **determine its form and survival**." (Encyclopedia Britannica)

### 2. Extreme events and disturbances

> Diseases, droughts, wildfires, and floods are examples of ecological disturbances that are increasing due to an unbalanced Earth system.

### 3. Projections

> Projections indicate that the world is speeding towards a warmer climate and will experience more catastrophic extreme events.


## "How can we use data science to help organisms (populations and communities) to adapt to a wild future?"
 
## The era of revolutions and their integrated role in environmental sciences

### 1. Digital revolution: using cyberinfrastructure to collect, store, and process data & deliver information

### 2. Big data revolution: using open socio-environment data collected across scales

> AI models can help us to classify, cluster, forecast and identify outliers. They also provide us with data simulation and model emulation. Digital Twin representation, find more at [Digital Twin Overview](https://www.esri.com/en-us/digital-twin).

## "But... why data cubes?"

### 1. Spatial data formats, referencing systems, and resolutions

> Sensors operate from different orbits and collect data with different Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV). These parameters result in data layers with varying spatial resolution.

### 2. Cutting-edge tools to process data on the fly and create data cubes
> - Clip to the Region of Interest (ROI)
> - Filter dates, times
> - Reproject to a standard Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) EPSG code
> - Resample every layer to a standard spatial resolution
> - Stack layers into a cube
