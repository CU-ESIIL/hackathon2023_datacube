> Yearly surface temperature compared to the 20th-century average from 1880â€“2022. Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.

### 2. Extreme events and disturbances

>Diseases, droughts, wildfires, and floods are examples of ecological disturbances that are increasing due to an unbalanced Earth system.


### 3. Projections

> Projections indicate that the world is speeding towards a warmer climate and will experience more catastrophic extreme events.

## The era of revolutions and their integrated role in environmental sciences

### 1. Digital revolution: using cyberinfrastructure to collect, store, and process data & deliver information

AI models can help us to classify, cluster, forecast and identify outliers. They also provide us with data simulation and model emulation. Digital Twin representation, find more at [Digital Twin Overview](https://www.esri.com/en-us/digital-twin).

 ### "But... why data cubes?"

>"Data cube is the arrangement of relevant data in an n-dimensional array to support analytics."

> We need paired samples to create a model and wall-to-wall layers to map predictions.

### 1. Spatial data formats, referencing systems, and resolutions
